Justine Moore Pitch

Hi Justine! I’m Amal (linkedin.com/in/amalsony). I’m the co-founder, of Teegle (teegle.app).

Teegle is a social network for learning that I founded with my co-founder, Nandha, who I’ve known since 1st grade. Nandha does marketing and I do the coding. We founded the company to solve discoverability for educational content. It started when I noticed that educational creators build their own software for their content (lengthly and a waste of their time) because YouTube doesn’t always cut it and have to market it themselves and it’s difficult for students find these products.  We’re solving this with Teegle Communities, Decks and Courses. Decks and Courses are a C2C Marketplace that enables educators and companies to create questions decks and courses designed specifically for school learning that students access through our Premium subscription and that’s why I’d like to tell you more about them.
